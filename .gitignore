# See https://help.github.com/articles/ignoring-files for more about ignoring files.
#
# If you find yourself ignoring temporary files generated by your text editor
# or operating system, you probably want to add a global ignore instead:
#   git config --global core.excludesfile '~/.gitignore_global'

# Ignore bundler config.
/.bundle

# Ignore the default SQLite database.
/db/*.sqlite3
/db/*.sqlite3-journal

# Ignore all logfiles and tempfiles.
/log/*
!/log/.keep
/tmp
.env.development
latest.dump

# Gems installed here to make repeated Docker builds a little quicker. Bundling
# can't be cached because of FURY_AUTH. Bundler checks this directory before it
# checks your system gems.
vendor/cache
/.ruby-version
